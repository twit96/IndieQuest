## Homepage
The homepage features an introduction blurb, current events, an about us blurb, 
and a section asking you to sign in. Clicking "The Journey" link in the navigation bar
will always redirect you to the homepage if you are logged out, and clicking the profile icon
in the top right corner will open a prompt asking you to log in.

After logging in, the homepage will update the login blurb to display your name. In addition,
clicking the profile icon will display a customized popup showing you which articles you have read
and which you have not yet read.
