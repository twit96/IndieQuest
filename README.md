  <img alt="Full Home Logged Out" src="/readme-files/full-home-loggedout.png">
  <br />
  The homepage features an introduction blurb, current events, an about us blurb, 
  and a section asking you to sign in. Clicking "The Journey" link in the navigation bar
  will always redirect you to the homepage if you are logged out.
