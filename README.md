## Homepage
The homepage features an introduction blurb, current events, an about us blurb, 
and a section asking you to sign in. Clicking "The Journey" link in the navigation bar
will always redirect you to the homepage if you are logged out, and clicking the profile icon
in the top right corner will open a prompt asking you to log in.

After logging in, the homepage will update the login blurb to display your name.

In addition, clicking the profile icon will display a customized popup showing you which 
articles you have read and which you have not yet read.

## Contact Page 
The contact page features images, blurbs, and relevant links pertaining to the project contributors.
In addition, an AJAX *contact us* form provides immediate user feedback on submissions, with backend 
PHP validation to ensure feedback comes from users with an account. This page, unlike the "The Journey"
page, **can** be accessed before a user logs in.
