            Limbo is a puzzle platformer that was created by an independent Danish studio, Playdead.
	    Microsoft Game studios helped publish the game and released it on July 21, 2010.
	    The player takes on the role of a boy who awakens in a dark eerie forest. The player must
	    then explore the world and solve environment puzzles to move on all while avoiding creatures like
	    spiders and bear traps. Not much is known about the boy's backstory or his environment
	    which seems to be left to the player to fill in the gaps. Although there was a minimal amount of story,
	    it helped to set the theme of the dark, eerie, and unknown world of Limbo.
	  </p>
          <p>
            The game was highly regarded for its unique dark aesthetics of a greyscale pallete with minimal sounds.
	    Another aspect that suprised many about the game was that it was priced high for its short gameplay,
	    but it was understood that the game presented itself as a "quality over quantity" experience that made up for it.
	    Due to its unique look, puzzle difficulty and short story, Limbo has been highly regarded as it proved a minimalistic game
	    can make an impact on players even in a short amount of time and was considered to be one of the best games of all time.
