          <h1>2014: Five Nights at Freddy's</h1>
          <p>Five Nights at Freddy's is a point and click horror survival game created by Scott Cawthon that was released for Windows on July 23, 2014.
	     Mr. Cawthon initially created Christian games that were not as well known, however, one day someone had complained that one of the characters
	     from one of his other games thought they looked creepy. The developer then got the idea to create a game that he thought was really frightening
	     with sinister animatronics. Five Nights at Freddy's is also based on the pizza franchise craze from the 80s such as Chuck E. Cheese's and ShowBiz Pizza.
	     The game starts with the player as a night security guard for Freddy Fazbear's Pizza set in the 80s where they must use the cameras, lights, and doors to
	     prevent the animatronics from killing them and stuffing them into an animatronic suit before 6 a.m.. The player cannot move and is set in a security office
	     with a computer and limited amount of battery. If the player loses energy, the lights shut off and Freddy jumps at the player.
	  </p>
          <p>
            The game heavily utilizes suspense as the player may be suprised to find an animatronic outside their door. The game made a huge impact in the survival horror
	    genre as there had not been a game with a concept of a creepy pizza joint. It helped to bring forth future games that use the concept of the player in one room
	    and many fan made games based off of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise.
